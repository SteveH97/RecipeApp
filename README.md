This is a recipe application which has some filters for cuisine, type of meal (ex: main dish, breakfast, etc) and options to choose for max protein, carbs and calories. There is a section called dishes that act like a cart where you choose up to three meals for a single day which then adds up the total of protein, carbs and calories. There is also a search bar to query for any type of food. The recipes will appear in a card component. I only set the max cards to 10 to save on the daily api limit, but I might bump it up higher to 20 or 30 once I put the application live. You can click on a certain card which will pop up a module with more information regarding the dish.

I used React, spoonacular API and the Redux state manager which was kind of tricky to learn when setting up the boiler-plate, but once I had that running it was pretty smooth sailing from there on out. Figuring out how to change the values in the Redux state, especially for an array was kind of tricky since you can't directly change it. You have to do it in an immutable way else there would be errors going off. I also came to use SCSS which is almost the same as CSS, but having the ability to use nested classes was really handy.
